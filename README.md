As part of my Django course, I am developing a project for my own blog. 
At the moment I have implemented url routing, made 3 pages with html templates and designed them with css. 
Also, at the moment the site works with sqlite database (implemented data models) and data interpolation from database to templates through views. 
Made admin panel and realized the ability to create posts and edit data through admin panel. 
The next steps - creation of forms to fill posts through the form. Work with authentication. 
Perhaps, I will try to implement a payment gateway.
